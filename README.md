# Smart-Door-lock-system
## Abstract
The goal of this system is to provide a platform that will allow any authorized person to enter a building automatically 
using facial detection and recognition technology.
It includes features like Live stream monitoring through the portal, logs maintenance, and user profles. 

## Problem Statement:
As security is the main concern nowadays, it is important to have a system that is
efficiently giving access to people who are willing to access the premises. So our
problem is to authenticate people who are willing to access the premises and
accordingly it should give access based on their identity. Apart from authenticated
access, it is also important that we maintain logs of people who are accessing the
premises. Logs of unauthorized persons also should be maintained. Based on the
identity of the person, access to the door should be given. If the person is not
recognized then the security person will decide if the person should be granted access
or not.
